          	<strong>You may be suffering from Steel Diptheria. What to expect: toe numbness and neck pain may start within a week, but both symptoms are usually equally intense. After the initial onset, toe numbness often becomes less severe after a few days. Around this time increased thirst is experienced by most people. The experience of increased thirst sometimes decreases the severity of the experience of neck pain. After a few more days feeling tired is experienced by about 25% of people and is usually experienced in the evening. Throughout the course of the disease, sleeping difficulty may be experienced, but only in only some cases and is generally not experienced to extreme levels. Cause: Unknown, but a weakened immune system is usually part of it. Made worse by: Certain medications. Caffeine. Stimulating drugs. Treatment: Heavy medication and suppressant routine.</strong><br />
