        <p> Hi, welcome to White Pawn Gaming, or WPG for short. We are a group of individuals who love to design, draw and code games. We love doing these and we love being able to give our creations to the world to play.<br />
          We are also proud to say that we are working in conjunction with another coding team known as <strong>Nui Gaming,</strong> who created HBHS Adventure, MrMcMan and many other somewhat decent games. <br />
          We love our community and hope that you can find a game that you like. <br />
          Enjoy your stay here. <br />
          -Jovan Xin (CEO of WPG)
