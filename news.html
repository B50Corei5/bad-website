			<h4>New Version of TPA!</h4>
			<p>A new version has been released, Version 1.3! This new version allows you to control the flashing lights on the "Epilepsy Mode" feature. Increasing this will make the lights flash faster. The new version also adds smoother control to the character and updates the gravity control. Lastly, some smaller graphical and other random changes have been made to make it look nicer.

			<h4>New Version of TPA!</h4>
			<p>A new version has been released, Version 1.2!

More work is going to be added onto it in the future as it is still a beta product.
